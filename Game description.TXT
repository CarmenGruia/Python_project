This python application implements a X and 0 game ( Tic Tac Toe ) using a graphic interface. It is a player vs computer game, where the computer moves depending on the difficulty chosen in the menu. Thus, if the game difficulty is easy, the computer will move randomly, if the game difficulty is hard, the computer will move smartly using the minmax algorithm , and if the game difficulty is medium the computer will move once randomly, once smartly. In the end, it will appear the winner, the score, and the opportunity to play again on the same difficulty ( it will keep the score ) or on another difficulty ( the score will be reseted ).
